# VanillaCommands Plugin

VanillaCommands is a custom plugin for PocketMine-MP that enhances the server's command functionality by adding new commands. This plugin aims to provide a more vanilla-like experience with additional commands for your PocketMine-MP server.

## Features

The VanillaCommands plugin currently supports the following command:

- `/setblock <x> <y> <z> <BlockName>` - Sets a block at the specified coordinates.

## Installation

To install the VanillaCommands plugin, follow these steps:

1. Download the latest version of the plugin from the [Releases](https://github.com/Amitminer/VanillaCommands/releases) page.
2. Place the downloaded plugin file into the `plugins` folder of your PocketMine-MP server.
3. Start or restart your server.

## Usage

Once the VanillaCommands plugin is installed, you can use the supported command as follows:

- `/setblock <x> <y> <z> <BlockName>` - Replace `<x>`, `<y>`, and `<z>` with the coordinates where you want to place the block. Replace `<BlockName>` with the name of the block you want to place. This command will set the specified block at the given coordinates.

## TODO

There are several planned enhancements for the VanillaCommands plugin, including:

- Securing the `/msg` and `/w` commands.
- Adding more commands for additional functionality.

Stay tuned for future updates!
